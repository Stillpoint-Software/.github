### Opening Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem? Do you have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can report your issue as effectively as possible.

#### Identify Where to Report

Our open source projects are distributed across multiple repositories. File the issue against the correct repository. 

#### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in open issues to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

Be sure to scan through the most popular feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your reaction. Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment.

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

#### Creating Issues

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

### Code Guidelines

- **Coding Style:** Follow the patterns, naming conventions, and style of the existing codebase as much as possible. Ensure your code is clean, readable, and well-documented.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests for your code. Make sure all existing and new tests pass before submitting your pull request.
- **Commit Messages:** Write clear, concise commit messages that describe your changes.

### Reviewing Process

All submissions will be reviewed by the project maintainers. We aim to review pull requests as quickly as possible, but please be patient as maintainers may have varying availability.

### Licensing

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
